# Day Tracker

Simplistic color-coded calendar app that uses JQuery and Day.js, and that incorporates local storage: so allowing user to save and track events of the day per hour. 


# Usage
The application uses Day.js to access time, while enabling users to apply and use text in a description section: with classes of past, present, and future. 

The different time frames are specified by various colors as follows: grey = past, red= current time, green= future.
